        <h1>I am a wife, a mother, and a woman completely in love with learning.<br><br>For me, the ideal company would
          offer a flexible work
          schedule and challenge me to continue to learn new skills while also providing me with a great environment to
          hone my existing ones. I thrive in open and fun environments and enjoy opportunities to learn from my peers. I
          have a history of being able to meet firm deadlines but truly believe lasting outcomes are more about the
          process than one ending product.
